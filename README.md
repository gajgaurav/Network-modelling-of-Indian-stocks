A fresh way of looking at stock trajectories over time based on concepts of recurrence from the dynamical systems literature. New metrics are defined to understand how closely certain
stocks mimic each others' behaviour, if at all. Graphical illustrations and comments will be added with time for better understanding. This was a joint project with Sanjay Sathish.
